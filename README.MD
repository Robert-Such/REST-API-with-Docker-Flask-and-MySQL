# REST API with Flask, Docker, PyCharm, Postman and MySQL
This project is to create a REST API and use Postman to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request
methods.

Docker Compose is being utilized to setup a python flask app and a mysql server which will load data from
the db/init.sql file during the first start up of the database.

The flask framework is being used to create a REST that can be tested with Postman to
demonstrate GET, POST, PUT, and Delete to retrieve, create, update, and delete records.
